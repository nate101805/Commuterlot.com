            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>The high number of buses in Hartford, West Hartford, and Windsor, CT, contributes significantly to environmental degradation due to emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants from diesel engines. These emissions lead to poor air quality, contributing to respiratory issues and climate change. Additionally, frequent bus routes often overlap, causing unnecessary fuel consumption and increased wear and tear on infrastructure, further exacerbating their negative environmental impact.</p>

            <h2>Why Commuter Lots are the Best Solution</h2>
            <div class="textbox">
                <p>Commuter lots are an effective solution to reduce environmental impact. By consolidating bus routes into fewer, more efficient services, commuter lots can decrease the number of buses on the road, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants. This also minimizes fuel consumption and lowers infrastructure wear and tear. Additionally, using large EV vans for shuttle services can further cut down on emissions, promoting a greener, healthier environment.</p>
